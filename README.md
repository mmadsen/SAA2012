_Improving the Fit Between Model and Data: Extreme Value Analysis of Unbiased Transmission_

Increasingly, neutral models form the basis for explanatory models in archaeology. Many of these models assume that class frequencies represent a synchronic sample. The assumption, however, is rarely justifiable since archaeological deposits are time-transgressive, and the result of time-averaging changes the distribution of observables. Class richness, for example, is an additive “maximum” value for accretional assemblages. Class frequencies, therefore, should be modeled using extreme value distributions of transmission processes, not central limit behavior. This change points to improvements that can be made to numerical methods that evaluate frequency expectations due to random copying.

## Description ##

It's possible that the formal extreme value component of this project is waning, but the general concept is still sound.  Counting measures that rely upon counts in categories (i.e., "balls in boxes" problems) may have their distributions changed by cumulative time-averaging.  

For example, the expected distribution of traits among individuals, even if the copying process is strictly neutral (and can be proven to be neutral in synchronic snapshot data), may be changed by cumulative time-averaging.  

This does not appear to be an instant or threshold phenomenon, but instead gradually occurs with greater time-averaging, and is more apparent at high levels of global innovation rate than at low rates.
